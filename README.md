A simple python medius implementation made specifically for Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal

# Philosophy
This server is meant to allow users as much freedom as possible while removing bugs and actively affect gameplay. This means that bug will only be fixed if it impacts a users experience in-game.

Bug fixes:
- Remove colors and button symbols in account names
	- Reason: Colors and button symbols get in the way, and make players harder to identify in-game
- Remove box/blob clan tags
	- Reason: Box/blob clan tags prevent players from seeing the other player sprites
- Remove button symbols in clan tags
	- Reason: Button symbols do not scale with distance, so when players see others with this tag from far away, the clan tag will block a significant view of the map

A simple python medius implementation made specifically for Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal

# Philosophy
This server is meant to allow users as much freedom as possible while removing bugs that **actively affect gameplay**. This means that bug will only be fixed **if it impacts a users experience in-game**.

Bug fixes:
- Remove colors and button symbols in account names
	- Reason: Colors and button symbols get in the way and make players harder to identify in-game
- Remove box/blob clan tags
	- Reason: Box/blob clan tags prevent players from seeing the other player sprites
- Remove button symbols in clan tags
	- Reason: Button symbols do not scale with distance, so when players see others with this tag from far away, the clan tag will block a significant view of the map

A simple python medius implementation made specifically for Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal

### Building
```
# Set the log directory at the bottom of the config
# Set the ports you want to use in config.json
# Then:
bash build.sh

# Then modify the ports in run.sh to the same ports in the config
bash run.sh
```

### Features
- Once a game has started, cities will show `[IG]` to indicate that the world is "in-game"
- Players can use the `!tagg [number]` or `!uagg [number]` in cities to set the DME TCP(tagg)/UDP(uagg) times manually for the next world they create. If a player sets these, then joins a game, they will be reset. The TCP/UDP agg time is the amount of time the server will aggregate packets before sending the data to the other players. The default in the game is 30 for both. Recommended values range from 10-100. UDP(uagg), is responsible for player movement, and more, while TCP(tagg) is responsible for wrench, and more.
